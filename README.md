# SAM-26
Scoring for the Survey of Autobiographical Memory, 26-Item

Scoring was obtained through correspondence with Brian Levine's research group and is based on the original SAM paper (Palombo et al., 2013).

Minimal requirements:
-scoring weights (proprietary) for each subscale and the total scale
-raw scores in one file

How it works:
-scoring weights are applied to the raw scores by question
-score is subtracted from 100, then rounded
-scores for 4 subscales and one total score --> 5 scores per person
-scores for all participants written out to one excel file Sam26_scores
-itemweights (weights x raw scores) all participants found in excel file as Sam26_itemweights
